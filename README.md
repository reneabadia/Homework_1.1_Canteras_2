Homework 1 of week 1 of Canteras 2

This project uses object-oriented programming to interact with Java classes.

The singular classes used are: 
-*Person*, which allows user information; 
-*Fruit*, which creates a fruit object with color and weight attributes; 
-*bankAccount*, which creates a bank account with a private methods to activate/deactivate it; 
-*Meat*, which creates a meat object, with weight attibutes, and the method of apply a discount.

In addition, two special classes were created to import the previous classes: 
-*Balance*, which creates a object balance to meassure accumulated weight of fruit and meat created. 
-*Customer* imports information from the Person class and assigns a category to this.
